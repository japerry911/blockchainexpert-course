# Notes

### Introduction to Cryptocurrency

- cryptocurrencies - are a form of decentralized digital money/currency
    - don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead they use a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units
- fiat currency - government issued currency that is not backed by a commodity
    - examples:
        - us dollar
        - canadian dollar
        - euro

### Ethereum Basics

- turing complete - refers to a machine or programming language that when given enough time, necessary instructions, and memory can solve any computational problem
- solidity - official programming language of Ethereum
    - smart contracts
    - turing complete

### Smart Contracts And DApps

- DApp - decentralized application that runs on a blockchain and utilizes the blockchain as single source of truth
- smart contracts - code that is stored on the blockchain that runs when certain conditions are met

### ERC-20 Tokens

- token - created by smart contract, relies on blockchain network
- coin - native cryptocurrency of the blockchain network
    - example - ether of ethereum
- erc-20 token - represents a standard for fungible tokens on ethereum
- fungible - refers to the ability to replace or to be replaced by another identical item
    - example - erc-20 tokens
- non-fungible - unique tokens, NFTs
 
### ERC-721 Tokens (NFTs)

- non-fungible - unique, can't be replaced
    - NFTs
    - have their own unique ID
- erc-721 token - standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on ethereum
    - contracts that represent an erc-721 token must implement specified functionality that allow for uniform usage/behvavior of these tokens

### Blockchain Comparisons

- layer 1 - refers to the base blockchain network such as ethereum or bitcoin and its underlying infrastructure
    - layer 1 networks can validate transactions independently
- layer 2 - refers to a protocol that relies on an integration with an existing layer 1 blockchain network
    - layer 2 networks are typically faster or provide scalability solutions, but may lack decentralization and security
