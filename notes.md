### introduction to blockchain

- blockchain
    - a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat
    - essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain
    - not owned a central entity

### centralized vs decentralized systems

- centralized systems
    - most systems today are centralized
    - controlled by single entity
- decentralization
    - process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group
    - allow for trust-less interactions

| Centralized Systems                             | Decentralized Systems                           |
| ------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------|
| low network diameter, allowing fast flow of data| large network diameter, data may flow slower    |
| simple to implement, highly performant usually  | difficult to implement with lower throughput    |
| data conflicts are easily solved                | complex protocol needed to dispute conflicts    |
| single point of failure, easy to take down      | no single point of failure                      |
| central authority that can sensor/modify data   | censorship is much harder, usually impossible   |
| participation is regulated by central authority | anyone can participate, no 'gatekeepers'        |
